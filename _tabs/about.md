Hey, I'm Austin! I'm an RF engineer interested in all things wireless, RF, and antenna related. Currently I work at Tesla in Palo Alto where I have been since graduating from Santa Clara University with a degree in electrical engineering. 

When I'm not working at my day (and sometimes night) job, I can be found slowly tinkering away at projects I've started, reading, lifting weights, making music, hiking, traveling, drinking a coffee, or drinking a beer.

If you have any questions about anything on this site or just want to reach out, please don't hesitate to get in touch via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-rothschild-5487747b/) or [email](mailto:aurothschild@gmail.com)!
