Hey, I'm Austin! I'm an RF engineer interested in all things wireless and have a deep interest in modern communication systems ranging from baseband protocols to hardware design, antennas, system integration, and everything in between. Currently I work at Tesla in Palo Alto where I have been since graduating from Santa Clara University with a degree in electrical engineering. 

When I'm not working at my day (and sometimes night) job, I can be found slowly tinkering away at projects I've started, reading, lifting weights, making music, hiking, traveling, sleeping, or drinking a coffee.

If you have any questions about anything on this site or just want to reach out, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
