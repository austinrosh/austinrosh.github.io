Current MS EE student at Stanford with a focus in analog/RF integrated circuits and communication systems. Interested in high speed analog/mixed-signal circuits for wireless/wireline applications and the DSP algorithms running on such platforms. I previously worked at Tesla as an RF Engineer on the Wireless Team designing and integrating RF hardware to support connectivity and localization systems, and most recently on the RF Design team at Apple with a focus on vision products.
